# geoinformatica

Python codes, libraries, modules for Geoinformatica class (UNAL)

The repository contains Python code for a basic introductory Python programming class. 
The course is for Geology majors, undergraduate level. It introduces Python programming
and provides some examples, notes and homework. 

For now, it will work as a repository for students to be able to download the material 
and run codes in their own systems. Later it is intended for students to be able to 
upload homewortk and for me (Germ√°n Prieto) to evaluate the codes in a simple way.
